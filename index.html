              <p>
                Growing up in India, mathematics and problem‑solving were not
                subjects — they were survival tools and a lens on the world. An
                early fascination with how systems work led to a love of computer
                science that has never faded. Those early years instilled
                resilience, humility, and an unshakeable work ethic.

                Entered the technology industry as a software engineer, quickly
                discovering that great code is only part of the equation. Mentors
                taught that clarity of thought, communication, and trust were the
                true multipliers. Fell in love with distributed systems and

          <h3>Platform Thinking</h3>
          <p class="phil-tag">Architecture</p>
          <p>
            The best engineers think in platforms, not features. A feature solves
            today's problem; a platform enables tomorrow's innovation. Invest in
            foundations and the superstructure takes care of itself.

          <h3>Hire for Trajectory, not just Resume</h3>
          <p class="phil-tag">People</p>
          <p>
            Skills can be taught. Curiosity, ownership, and the drive to be 1%
            better every day cannot. I look for the light in someone's eyes when
            they talk about hard problems.

          <h3>Speed Is a Feature</h3>
          <p class="phil-tag">Execution</p>
          <p>
            Velocity compounds. A team that ships, learns, and iterates will always
            outrun a team that plans, polishes, and delays. Perfection is the enemy
            of shipped. Done thoughtfully beats planned perfectly.

          <h3>First Principles over Frameworks</h3>
          <p class="phil-tag">Thinking</p>
          <p>
            Every framework is someone else's first principles. Understanding the
            reasoning behind best practices gives you the freedom to break them when
            the situation demands. Think deeply before you copy blindly.

          <p class="phil-tag">Design</p>
          <p>
            Complexity is easy. Anyone can add — the art is in knowing what to
            remove. The most elegant systems I have seen carry years of deliberate
            subtraction. Pursue simplicity relentlessly; it is the ultimate
            sophistication.

          <p class="phil-tag">Culture</p>
          <p>
            What a team ships is a direct reflection of how that team operates. If
            the culture is broken, the codebase will tell you. Invest in
            psychological safety, candour, and clarity of purpose — and the
            technology follows.

          <p>
            The engineers and leaders who embrace AI as a force multiplier will
            define the next decade. AI does not replace great judgement — it
            accelerates the impact of those who have it. Stay curious; the learning

            The hardest leadership skill is saying no with confidence and empathy.
            Doing fewer things with greater depth consistently beats spreading thin
            across many. Alignment on what not to do is as valuable as alignment on
            what to do.
